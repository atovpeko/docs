# Hypercore

Hypercore is the TimescaleDB hybrid row-columnar storage engine, designed specifically for
real-time analytics and powered by time-series data. The advantage of hypercore is its ability
to seamlessly switch between row-oriented and column-oriented storage. This flexibility enables
Timescale Cloud to deliver the best of both worlds, solving the key challenges in real-time analytics.
