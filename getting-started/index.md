# Get started with Timescale

<CloudIntro />

This section shows you how to:

1.  [Create and connect to a $SERVICE_LONG][services-create]: choose the capabilities that match your business and 
    engineering needs on $COMPANY's cloud-based PostgreSQL platform. 
1.  [Run queries from $CONSOLE][run-queries-from-console]: securely interact your data in the $CONSOLE UI. 
1.  [Try the main features in Timescale products][test-drive]: rapidly implement the features in $CLOUD_LONG that
    enable you to ingest and query data faster while keeping prices low.

What next? See the [use case tutorials][tutorials], interact with the data in your $SERVICE_LONG using 
[your favorite programming language][connect-with-code], integrate your $SERVICE_LONG with a range of 
[third-party tools][integrations], plain old [Use Timescale][use-timescale], or dive into [the API][use-the-api].
