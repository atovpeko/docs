# Efficient storage

Intro sentence explaining what data security and reliability is and how the information in the section helps the end user perform
common tasks.

The main workflows you need to accomplish for access and control in Timescale Cloud are:

- **Import data into your service**
  Data is continuously ingested into Timescale Cloud from various sources, such as IoT devices, applications, or other databases.
  Reliable data ingestion mechanisms ensure that data is received without loss or corruption.
- **Ensure data availability and accessibility**
   Timescale Cloud automatically replicates data across different nodes or regions.
   This replication creates redundant copies of the data, ensuring that it remains accessible even if one node or data center fails.
- **Automated Backups**
   Regular, automated backups are taken at defined intervals.
   These backups are stored securely and can be used to restore the database to a specific point in time in case of accidental data deletion, corruption, or system failure.
- **High Availability Configuration**
   Timescale Cloud provides built-in high availability (HA) configurations.
   With HA enabled, failover mechanisms automatically promote a standby replica in case of the primary node failure, ensuring minimal disruption and reliable access to data.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**
   Continuous monitoring of the systemâ€™s performance and health is implemented.
   Alerts are triggered if performance degradation, replication lag, or other issues are detected, allowing for proactive measures to prevent failures.
- **Data Retention Policies**
   Data retention policies help manage the storage and retention of historical data.
   These policies ensure that only relevant data is kept, while old or unnecessary data is pruned based on predefined rules. This process helps optimize storage resources and improve system performance.
- **Disaster Recovery**
   In the event of a disaster, such as a full data center failure, disaster recovery mechanisms are in place.
   Backups, replication, and failover systems allow the database to be restored with minimal data loss, ensuring reliability and resilience.
- **Performance Optimization**
   Continuous performance tuning and optimization features, such as adaptive compression and index optimization, help maintain the reliability of the system.
   Efficient data retrieval and storage management enhance overall data reliability by preventing bottlenecks and ensuring consistent performance.
